    <p>OpenStax believes that everyone has something to learn, and everyone has something to teach.</p>
    <p>Frustrated by the limitations of traditional textbooks and courses, Dr. Richard Baraniuk founded OpenStax (then Connexions) in 1999 at Rice University to provide authors and learners with an open space where they can share and freely adapt educational materials such as courses, books, and reports. </p>
    <p>Today, OpenStax CNX is a dynamic non-profit digital ecosystem serving millions of users per month in the delivery of educational content to improve learning outcomes.</p>
    <p>There are tens of thousands of learning objects, called <b>pages</b>, that are organized into thousands of textbook-style <b>books</b> in a host of disciplines, all easily accessible online and downloadable to almost any device, anywhere, anytime.</p>
    <p>The best part? Everything is available for free thanks to generous support from Rice University and several philanthropic organizations.</p>

    <p>OpenStax CNX is designed to encourage the sharing and reuse of educational content. The knowledge in OpenStax CNX can be shared and built upon by all because it is reusable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>educationally:</b> We encourage authors to write each page to stand on its own so that others can easily use it in different collections and contexts specially designed for their students.</li>
      <li><b>technologically:</b> all content is built in a simple semantic HTML5 format rich with built-in accessibility features to ensure it can all be read by everyone. Also the OpenStax CNX toolset makes it easy for author to create and adapt content using a word processor similar to Google Docs or Word.</li>
      <li><b>legally:</b> all content produced in OpenStax is available under a Creative Commons open-content licenses. This makes it easy for authors to share their work - allowing others to use and reuse it legally - while still getting recognition and attribution for their efforts. The OpenStax CNX software maintains attribution to the original author for you, making remixing a cinch.</li>
